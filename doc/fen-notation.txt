# Forsyth–Edwards Notation
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Forsyth–Edwards Notation (FEN) is a standard notation for describing a particular board position of a chess game. The purpose of FEN is to provide all the necessary information to restart a game from a particular position.

FEN is based on a system developed by Scottish newspaper journalist David Forsyth. Forsyth's system became popular in the 19th century; Steven J. Edwards extended it to support use by computers. FEN is defined[2] in the "Portable Game Notation Specification and Implementation Guide".[1] In the Portable Game Notation for chess games, FEN is used to define initial positions other than the standard one.[3] FEN does not provide sufficient information to decide whether a draw by threefold repetition may be legally claimed or a draw offer may be accepted; for that, a different format such as Extended Position Description is needed.
# Definition
A FEN "record" defines a particular game position, all in one text line and using only the ASCII character set. A text file with only FEN data records should have the file extension ".fen".[4]

A FEN record contains six fields. The separator between fields is a space. The fields are:[5]

-Piece placement (from White's perspective). Each rank is described, starting with rank 8 and ending with rank 1; within each rank, the contents of each square are described from file "a" through file "h". Following the Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN), each piece is identified by a single letter taken from the standard English names (pawn = "P", knight = "N", bishop = "B", rook = "R", queen = "Q" and king = "K"). White pieces are designated using upper-case letters ("PNBRQK") while black pieces use lowercase ("pnbrqk"). Empty squares are noted using digits 1 through 8 (the number of empty squares), and "/" separates ranks.
-Active color: "w" means White moves next, "b" means Black moves next.
-Castling availability: If neither side can castle, this is "-". Otherwise, this has one or more letters: "K" (White can castle kingside), "Q" (White can castle queenside), "k" (Black can castle kingside), and/or "q" (Black can castle queenside). A move that temporarily prevents castling does not negate this notation.
-En passant target square in algebraic notation: If there's no en passant target square, this is "-". If a pawn has just made a two-square move, this is the position "behind" the pawn. This is recorded regardless of whether there is a pawn in position to make an en passant capture.[6]
-Halfmove clock: This is the number of halfmoves since the last capture or pawn advance. The reason for this field is that the value is used in the fifty-move rule.[7]
-Fullmove number: The number of the full move. It starts at 1, and is incremented after Black's move.

FEN Syntax
One FEN string or record consists of six fields separated by a space character. The first four fields of the FEN specification are the same as the first four fields of the EPD specification.

The Piece Placement is determined rank by rank in big-endian order, that is starting at the 8th rank down to the first rank. Each rank is separated by the terminal symbol '/' (slash). One rank, scans piece placement in little-endian file-order from the A to H.

A decimal digit counts consecutive empty squares, the pieces are identified by a single letter from standard English names for chess pieces as used in the Algebraic Chess Notation. Uppercase letters are for white pieces, lowercase letters for black pieces.
Terminal and nonterminal symbols of a variant of BNF below are embedded in ' ' resp. < >.

<FEN> <Piece Placement> ::= <rank8>'/'<rank7>'/'<rank6>'/'<rank5>'/'<rank4>'/'<rank3>'/'<rank2>'/'<rank1>
							<ranki>       ::= [<digit17>]<piece> {[<digit17>]<piece>} [<digit17>] | '8'
							<piece>       ::= <white Piece> | <black Piece>

# Examples
FEN for the starting position:

rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1

And after the move 1.e4:

rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3 0 1

And then after 1...c5:

rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6 0 2

And then after 2.Nf3:

rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2
